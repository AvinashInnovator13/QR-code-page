## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Before the project, I had never touched Git and GitHub so for the first time just because of this project I learned it and build a new skill in my skillset.

2. I also learned about **Media Query** in this project.

3. I learned how to write markdown



### Continued development

After this project, I would definitely like to work on the responsiveness of my project.


### Useful resources

- [Git and GitHub](https://youtu.be/Ez8F0nW6S-w?si=sndrXzvNZDZ6dKnU) - The course really helped me understand Concepts of Git and GitHub. If you know Hindi or Urdu langauge I would definitely recommend this course to you.
